## Decorators

# Instructions

`time.time()` will return the current time in seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 

Try running the starting code to see the current time printed.

If you run the code after a while, you'll see a new time printed.

e.g. first run:

1598524371.736911

second run:

1598524436.357875

The time difference = second run - first run

64.62096405029297

(approx 1 minute)

Given the above information, complete the code exercise by printing out the speed it takes to run the `fast_function()` vs the `slow_function()`. You will need to complete the `speed_calc_decorator()` function.
